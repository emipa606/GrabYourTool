Do your pawns always have the right tool for the job? Then why the hell don't they use them already?

With this mod, pawns carrying a tool relevant to their current job will equip them when starting the job. Does NOT activate when drafted or hunting.

**Update:**
This mod now also adds the ability to command colonists to pick up specific items to carry around in their inventory even when not part of a caravan.

**Update again:**
Pawns will now switch back to their previously equipped weapon when finished using a tool for a job
